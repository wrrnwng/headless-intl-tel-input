# International Telephone Input for Headless UI

This is a Headless UI wrapper for the [intl-tel-input](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input) library.

## Why did I need to do this?

I ran into [an issue](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/issues/1545) where the click event from outside the Headless UI Dialog stops propagation.

This is just my solution to this issue.
